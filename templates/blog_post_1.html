                <h1>Lineup Recommender <small>&laquo;Blog Post 1&raquo;</small></h1>

            <h2>Part 1: Introduction</h2>
            <p>For our project, we decided to analyze NBA player scores by game in order to find optimal fantasy basketball lineups for website like FanDuel and DraftKings. We want to look at a player's historical game performance and then predict that player's performance in a future game. We can then take these projected scores to recommend the optimal lineup of players for users of the websites mentioned above. Below are some specific questions we're hoping to tackle in the process.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Can we consistently predict the performance of low variance players? If so, should we tend to lean towards selecting low variance players to become more risk averse in the long run.</li>
                <li>Can we predict success of low salaried players who have a high variance in their performances? This would help us replace the least useful high salaried players and consequently give us better odds of winning contests because most users tend to choose high salary players.</li>
                <li>Can we incorporate metrics opposing team, home or away, etc. into our prediction model? If so, can we determine what subset of these metrics provides best results and why?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The NBA player data (shown below) is obtained from stats.nba.com. It contains the player scores, with each entry representing a particular player's score for a particular game. Each player's score is broken down into their 3-point and 2-point field goals made, freethrows, steals, blocks, rebounds, assists, and turnovers.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p>We also obtain projections and salary data from Swish Analytics (shown below). We currently used this data to calculate the optimal lineup which is what we use in the Visualization section below. We are also using this data as an example to compare with the projections we make in the ML section below.</p>

            <h3>Useful Features</h3>
            We've built the following small modules to make our lives easier for the rest of the semester:
            <ul>
                <li>Reusable populate db module that will flush the redis db and repopulate it with combined data from swish and nba after cleaning them. The module is general enough to adapt to changes in the data.</li>
                <li>Reusable updater module that will get stats at any given point of time from both nba and swish and update the db to keep up with daily changes.</li>
                <li>Testing module that has unittests for different functionalities provided by Flask, Redis, Swish Analytics and NBA.</li>
                <li>Reusable scraping module that uses beautiful soup and requests to get data from swish and any subdomain of stats.nba.com with a data endpoint.</li>
                <li>Finally, we've deployed the app to heroku. So, we don't need to use WordPress! :)</li>
            </ul>

            <script src="static/js/viz2.js"></script>

            <div id="lineup">
              <table class="table table-striped" align="center" style="width:70%;" id="viz">
                <thead>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Position</th> 
                    <th>Name</th>

                </thead>
                <tbody>
                </tbody>

            <p>
                This visualization shows the lineup in a visual list, as it is done on FanDuel or DraftKings. This is how our lineup will be displayed on the page as the end product, detailing the player's position, name, team, projected fantasy points, and salary. 
            </p>
            <h3>How to get an optimal lineup</h3>
            <p> 
                We want to come up with a simple lineup of 9 players. We have considered two ways of coming up with an algorith: brute-force and dynamic programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                We wrote the brute-force solution, so that we could potentially compare that lineup (which should be optimal, meaning the lineup gives the highest projected score for a game) with our solution using dynamic programming. Unfortuantely, brute-force takes too long to run, which makes sense because we're comparing every possible combinations of lineups (9 players from different positions). It didn't run.
            </p>
            <p>
                We realized that it is really difficult to come up with an optimal lineup, otherwise, too. Thus, this is our simple solution for now.
            </p>
            <p>
                The players are grouped by positions, and sorted by points in descending order. For example, all players with the Center position are in one list, and the player with the highest projected score appears first in the list. At this point, we have a list of 5 lists (representing 5 positions). We are selecting one player for the Center position, and 2 players for the other 4 positions - this makes a total of 9 players in a lineup.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have a salary cap of 60 million dollars to give to one lineup. Thus, we are giving 60,000,000/9 dollars to a player. When choosing the first player, for the Center position for instance, we pick the one with the highest point, and if his salary falls under 60,000,000/9. When choosing the second player, we pick the player with the highest point, and if his salary plus the first player's salary falls under (60,000,000/9)*2. We continue doing this process till we have chosen the 9th player. In case, the first player's salary is under 60,000,000/9 and the second player's is over 60,000,000/9, we should still want to pick the 2nd player if he has the highest projected point. This is the best we can do to best allocate our money in accordance to the salary cap.

            <h2>Part 3: Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>
                Once we have our NBA player data, we can apply machine learning to predict projected player scores. We decided to use logistic regression to make the projections.
            </p>
            <p>
                We transform our player data from their goals, freethrows, assists, etc. into a single FanDuel score. Then, we associate each player's FanDuel score for a game with the average FanDuel score of the prior <i>n</i> games. We create an aggregation of these scores-to-averages for all games a player has played.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to find the most optimal <i>n</i> prior games to compute the scores-to-averages aggregation, we looked for an <i>n</i> that maximized its respective aggregation's R<sup>2</sup> score. To do this, we first gathered the scores-to-averages aggregations from <i>n=1</i> prior games to <i>n=40</i> prior games for all players. Then we calculated the R<sup>2</sup> score for all of these scores-to-averages aggregations, and picked the <i>n</i> aggregation per player that had the maximal R<sup>2</sup> score. Finally, out of the best <i>n</i> values per player, we found the most common <i>n</i> value that maximized a player aggregation's R<sup>2</sup> score. Interestingly, the most common <i>n</i> value turned out to be 7. This suggests that we only need to look at the 7 prior games for a player to make an accurate projection of their performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, we applied our ML algorithm to make predictions. For a given player, we take their historic game scores and perform a scores-to-averages aggregation; this aggregation looks at the averaged 7 prior game scores per game score (based on our findings above). We give this to a logistic regression as training data, with scores as the training features and averages as training labels.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this trained logistic regression for a player, we can then give it the player's most recent 7 games, and predict their next game's FanDuel score. We also compared this to Swish Analytics' FanDuel projection for that player, and found similar results. Below are sample projections and actual scores for games played on 3/22/2016:
            </p>
            <table class="table table-striped" border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3">
                <tr>
                    <td>Player Name</td>
                    <td>Logistic Regression</td>
                    <td>Swish Analytics</td>
                    <td>Actual Score</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Jrue Holiday</td>
                    <td>42</td>
                    <td>52.24</td>
                    <td>47.5</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Goran Dragic</td>
                    <td>28</td>
                    <td>32.34</td>
                    <td>37.1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Dion Waiters</td>
                    <td>23</td>
                    <td>11.76</td>
                    <td>28</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                We chose these examples to show players with high, medium, and low projection scores.

            <h2>Part 4: Discussion</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>What is hardest part of the project that you've encountered so far?</b>
                    <p>For fantasy scoring, it is not possible to rely on just one source of data to get all information because NBA does not provide fantasy salaries and the fantasy websites do not provide historical data. So, we had to combine data from two sources - NBA and Swish Analytics. We need this data to be updated every day, so we needed to build a module that can just be run each day to update the data. But, the module has to take into account the possibilities of data changing and inconsistent data. Building this module was definitely the hardest part of the project so far.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>What are your initial insights?</b>
                    <p>We're able to come up with reasonable projections that are quite comparable to those of Swish Analytics. We haven't been able to evaluate how good our results were against real data yet but we'll be doing that as the next step.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Are there any concrete results you can show at this point? If not, why not?</b>
                    <p>We've been able to get the optimal lineup given projection data and we've been able to project fantasy scores based on historical data.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Going forward, what are the current biggest problems you're facing?</b>
                    <p>One problem we're facing is trying to figure out which ML algorithms or what kind of pure stats could help us improve our predictions. Other than that, we're not facing any specific problems.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Do you think you are on track with your project? If not, what parts do you need to dedicate more time to?</b>
                    <p>We think we're on track especially considering the fact that we'll be able to dedicate a lot more time to the project after Spring Break because the workload from the class reduces.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Given your initial exploration of the data, is it worth proceeding with your project?</b>
                    <p>Definitely! The initial exploration has proven to be very exciting. Especially the insight that last 7 games is a good indicator of performance. We're excited to see where else we can go with this project.
